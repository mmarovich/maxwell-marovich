        quote: `When Marco Polo came at last to Cathay, seven hundred years ago, did he not feel - and did his heart not falter as he realized - that this great and splendid capital of an empire had had its being all 
the years of his life and far longer, and that he had been ignorant of it? That it was in need of nothing 
from him, from Venice, from Europe? That it was full of wonders beyond his understanding? That his arrival 
was a matter of no importance whatever? We know that he felt these things, and so has many a traveller in 
foreign parts who did not know what he was going to find. There is nothing that cuts you down to size like 
coming to some strange and marvellous place where no one even stops to notice that you stare about you.`,
