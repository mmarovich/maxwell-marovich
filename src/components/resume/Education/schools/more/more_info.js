        description: `I was hired at Trilogy in October, 2017, but- having access to their curriculum- I still see my 
experiences their as primarily educational.  The best jobs are ones where you always learn something new, and I can honestly
say that I have learned so much through, not just the content of the program, but by all of the instructors, teaching 
assistants, student success managers, and students I have had the pleasure of working with.  I am currently teaching two
courses: one having a focus on javascript, and the other having a focus on Ruby on Rails.`

        description: `I started my web development studies with my mentor, Jacquie Howard, moving through the platform at Thinkful. 
Most of my learning was independent, and needed to solve my own problems by using google or reaching out to a community on 
Slack.  I was able to gracefully make a career switch afterward.  Here I learned how to include myself in a field where there
is always a problem to solve.`

This not only acted as a gateway to my financial and social development, but to my self-awareness and health as well.  I owe 
a lot to this field.`
