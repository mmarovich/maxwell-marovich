    {
        quote: `It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.`,
        source: `Aristotle, "Metaphysics"`,
        image: require(`../../../assets/images/aristotle.jpg`),
        explanation: `This quote perfectly describes what I feel is the most important lesson for humans today, 
just as it was for humans over two thousand years ago.  There is nothing that stagnates progress more than our inability to
merely talk about subjects that make us feel uncomfortable or debate against opinions that we disagree with.  To quote Data
from Star Trek; TNG, "Is your argument so weak, that it cannot withstand debate?"`
    },
    {
        quote: `When Marco Polo came at last to Cathay, seven hundred years ago, did he not feel - and did his heart not 
falter as he realized - that this great and splendid capital of an empire had had its being all the years of his life 
and far longer, and that he had been ignorant of it? That it was in need of nothing from him, from Venice, from Europe? 
That it was full of wonders beyond his understanding? That his arrival was a matter of no importance whatever? ...There 
is nothing that cuts you down to size like coming to some strange and marvellous place where no one even stops to notice 
that you stare about you.`,
        source: `Richard Adams, "Watership Down"`,
        image: require(`../../../assets/images/watershipdown.jpg`),
        explanation: `To me, there are few thoughts more profound than the realization that - when I look outside myself - I
am ignorant to virtually all events happening currently, and it exists unbeknownst to me until the moment I discover it.`
    },
    {
        quote: `The stupid neither forgive nor forget; the naive forgive and forget; the wise forgive but do not forget.`,
        source: `Thomas Stephen Szasz, Psychiatrist`,
        image: require(`../../../assets/images/psychiatry.jpg`),
        explanation: `One might argue that forgetting is not a choice.  Everyone makes mistakes, and I know how it feels to 
not be forgiven simply for being human.  I make sure to treat people from an empathetic point of view, because pushing people 
away for being human means running the risk of pushing everyone away.`
    },
    {
        quote: `And Lot's wife, of course, was told not to look back where all those people and their homes had been. But 
she did look back, and I love her for that, because it was so human. So she was turned into a pillar of salt. So it goes.`,
        source: `Kurt Vonnegut, "Slaughterhouse Five"`,
        image: require(`../../../assets/images/dresden.jpg`),
        explanation: `Truth and logic are important to me. Most people go their whole lives looking for ways to justify what
they already believe.  In the end, for me, being able to admit I don't know is much more important than needing to be right.`
    },
    {
        quote: `Be excellent to each other. Party on, dudes!`,
        source: `Bill S Preston Esquire and Ted Theodore Logan, "Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"`,
        image: require(`../../../assets/images/billandted.gif`),
        mark: true,
        sound: `/assets/audio/In_Time.mp3`,
        explanation: `One of the most important lessons that I've learned from my youth is that, whenever possible, being 
kind to others is the ultimate catalyst for positive and social growth. In turn, being able to have fun is how all of us 
are able to wake up with something to look forward to.`
    },
    {
        quote: `The only true wisdom is in knowing that you know nothing.`,
        source: `Socrates`,
        image: require(`../../../assets/images/socrates.jpg`),
        explanation: `I feel that one of the greatest virtues a person can have is being able to admit that they don't know.`
    },
    {
        quote: `If we're going to be damned, let's be damned for what we really are.`,
        source: `Captain Jean-Luc Picard, "Star Trek; The Next Generation"`,
        image: require(`../../../assets/images/enterprise_d.jpg`),
        explanation: `Be yourself, especially if you feel you are under scrutiny. There are few worse feelings than having been
criticized for behavior that doesn't reflect you.`
